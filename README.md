**Introducation**:

Here's a basic Markdown representation of the Hangman game, including instructions and a simple game loop:

*Objective*: Guess the secret word before the hangman is fully drawn. 

**How to Play**:
- Choose a word: One player (or the computer) secretly selects a word.
- Represent the word: Display the word as a series of underscores, one for each letter. For example, if the word is "CAT", display "_ _ _".
- Guess letters: The other player guesses letters one at a time.

Feedback:
- If the guessed letter is in the word, reveal it in the correct position(s). 
- If the guessed letter is not in the word, draw a part of the hangman (e.g., head, body, arms, legs).
- Continue guessing: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until either:
- The player guesses the word correctly, or
- The hangman is fully drawn, indicating a loss.

Win/Lose:
- If the player guesses the word correctly, they win.

- If the hangman is fully drawn before the word is guessed, the player loses.
